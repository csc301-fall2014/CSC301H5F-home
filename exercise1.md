# Exercise 1

## Register for a team by Sunday, Sept 21, at 7 p.m

 * Please register for a team by filling in your **GitHub username** in [this shared doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14i4aOxqxCU2gdshJWj-l7vvMtMVidhe38I3Lj1W7z-0/edit?usp=sharing).
 * Up to 6 people per team.
 * Small teams (i.e. less than 4) might get merged with other teams.
 * The teams for this exercise, and the teams for the project are different (think of this exercise as a "test run").
 * If you don't register for a team on time, you will **lose 25% of the mark** for this exercise.


That's it for now, on Sunday night we will create your team repositories that you will use for this exercise.
