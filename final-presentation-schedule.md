I understand that the presentation might conflict with other classes for some students.
Students who cannot attend the final presentation should ask one of their teammates to present their individual contribution.

Just to be 100% clear:
 * In the handout it says "Each member should say 2-3 sentences about their individual contribution to the team".
 * If you cannot attend the presentation, it is your responsibility to write the 2-3 sentences describing your individual contribution, 
   and make sure that one of your teammates actually presents them to the class.
