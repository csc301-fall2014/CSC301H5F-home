# Online University Portal

## Initial Discussion

  * What is the one feature you want most?
    * I don't know, there's a whole bunch of features that we want.
  * What's your timeline like?
    * We would like to release the portal in about a year.
  * Is the system going to be focused on the courses?
    * Not sure, we should figure this one out.
  * How many types of users are you going to have?
    * For now, 3 ... Students, Instructors, and administrative staff.
  * Do you have any ideas for GUI design?
    * Not at all
  * What do the different types of users want to do with the system?
    * Instructors - Save time managing the class
    * Students - Too many requirests to really understand.
    * Administrative Staff - Saving time, and avoiding useless email correspondence.
  * What kind of traffic do you expect?
    * About 5K users a day.
  * Can I have access to your market research data (i.e. user feedback)?
    * No. It's confidential, you can talk to me.

### User stories

We will only focus on Charlotte

 * I want to access the portal on my mobile, so I can use it on the go.
 * I want to view announcement in one central place, so that it's easy to manage, and I don't miss out on any important info.
 * I want to access my class list.
 * I want the different function (e.g. class list vs portal announcements) to in separate "areas" of the portal, because it makes it easier to manage.
 * I want a global search, so that I can find any relevant information easily.
 * I want **all** of my courses available, so I don't have to keep track of too many bookmarks.
 * I want to receive all important announcements from all of my courses in one place in the portal, so that I don't miss out on anything.
 * I want a flexible notification system (email, SMS, push notification), so that I don't miss anything.
 * I want a calendar with all of my due dates, it makes things easier to manage.
 
Seems like the most important feature to students is the ability to organize their time.
