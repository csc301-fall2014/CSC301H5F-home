# Phase 4 - Final Presentation

The goals of this phase are to complete the work, and present (different aspects of) your finished project.


## Deliverables

 * [Live presentation](#live-presentation) (time and location TBD)
 * The following deliverables are to be submitted to your team repo:
   * [`Phase4/Product.md`](#phase4productmd)
   * [`Phase4/Process.md`](#phase4processmd)
   * [`Phase4/Architecture.md`](#phase4architecturemd)
   * [`Phase4/IndividualReports.md`](#phase4individualreportsmd)

### Live presentation

Your presentation should include the following items (in any order you see fit):

 * Product (3-5 minutes)
   * Introduce your product.
   * Highlight the feature(s) that make it unique (i.e. features that were not in [the original handout](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H1F-L5101-Home/blob/master/ProjectOptions.md)).
   * Short live demo.
 * Process (3-5 minutes)
   * Introduce the team - Each member should say 2-3 sentences about their individual contribution to the team.
   * Mention some of the highlights of your process(es).     
     For example: Using GitHub, communicating, scheduling, any standards/conventions you have developed.
   * Tell us about difficulties you faced, working together as a team (i.e. identify some of the team's decisions that, in hindsight, caused the team to be inefficient).
   * Tell us about standards/conventions/techniques that worked well for your team (i.e. identify some of the team's decisions that, in hindsight, helped the team work efficiently).
 * Software Architecture (3-5 minutes)
   * Run us through the way your software is built - What are its main components? What are their responsibilities? How do they interact with one another?
   * Tell us about the technologies and tools that you used.
   * Mention interesting technical challenges you faced, and/or interesting software techniques that you used. 

Other instructions:
 * Suggestion: Prepare the presentation in two steps:
   1. Decide _what_ content you want to present.
   2. Decide _how_ to organize the content to create a presentation with a natural flow.
 * The total time of the presentation (including questions) is __at most 15 minutes__.
   * The time limit is strict.
   * During your presentation, we might ask you a question or two. Make sure you leave some time for that.     
     That is, you should be able to present all of the content in 12 minutes.
 * It is up to you to decide which team member(s) get to present.


### `Phase4/Product.md`

A short report telling us the highlights of your __product__.
 * Max' 500 words.
 * The goals of this report are:
   * Inform potential users of the major product decisions you made:
     * Which features (that weren't a part of [the original handout](https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/CSC301H1F-L5101-Home/blob/master/ProjectOptions.md)) did you choose to focus on?
     * How do you expect a typical user to use your product? (i.e. run us through a quick scenario or two).
   * Give your TA and/or instructor some context, before they see your live presentation.

### `Phase4/Process.md`

A reflection on the software development processes your team ended up using.

 * Max' 500 words.
 * Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for your team. Explain why.
 * Tell us about tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for your team. Explain why.
 * If you had to continue working as a team, and design your process, what would your process look like?     
   In other words, describe an ideal process __for your team__, based on your experience working together.

### `Phase4/Architecture.md`

A report describing the architecture of your program.

 * Max' 500 words.
 * We want to know what are the major components of your system, and how they interact with one another.
 * Feel free to use diagrams.
 * Choose one or two of the most significant architecture decisions you've made, and tell us:
   * What was the reasoning behind these decisions?
   * Do you still think these were good decisions?

### `Phase4/IndividualReports.md`

For this part, each member should write a very short report that answers the following items:

 * What is your most significant individual contribution?
 * Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
 * What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
 * What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

Please keep it short - You should answer each item in 1-3 sentences.

Although these are individual reports, we ask you to submit all the reports in a single file to the team repo.      
Please follow [this template](phase4-individual-reports-template.md).
