# CSC301, Project Options


##  Messaging Application for Universities
#### Android/Web/Console-application

A messaging app that allows users to send/receive messages by topic. The idea is to provide students (and perhaps instructors, admin staff, etc.) with a convenient tool to broadcast (and consume) important/relevant information. 

The most basic features are:
 * A user can post messages to specific topic(s).
 * A user sees messages from all the topics he/she has subscribed for.

Just to give you an idea, here are example of hypothetical topics that could make sense: _1st Year Students_, _CSC301_, _Victoria College Events_, _St. George Traffic and Parking Notifications_, _Roommates Wanted_, etc.


## Time Management Tool for Students
#### Android/Web/Console-application

A tool that allows students to conveniently manage their schedule. The main highlight of the product is that it has all lecture and tutorial times, as well as all due dates, in one place.

The main challenge in this project comes from the (very realistic) assumption that instructors will not be cooperative. That is, you cannot count on instructors to create/update due dates. Your system, like most modern systems, should deal with this challenge by letting its users generate and validate the data.


## Frosh Week Treasure Hunt App
#### Android

[Treasure Hunt](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTreasure_hunt_%2528game%2529&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF96uF5D_3PYDeXyLgz9MglCz45bQ) is a classic choice for an event like Frosh Week - New students get to meet each other and explore the campus. The goal of this project is to build an app that will make a Frosh Week Treasure Hunt game a better experience.

Just to give you an idea, here are a few ways (some of them are too ambitious for this course) to improve a Treasure Hunt game using an app:
 * Notify teams whenever a competing team finds a clue.
 * Allow the Frosh Leaders to send extra clues to teams.
 * Whenever a team finds a clue, they need to take a picture, and at the end of the day, we end up with cool collages.
 * Provide students with online coupons to local cafes/restaurants as part of the game.
 * Indicate (hot/cold) whether you are getting closer to the location of the next clue, using the phoneâ€™s GPS.
 * Etc.
