## Reviewer : GitHub username 1

NOTE: This is an example of a good format for a code review - It is very short, yet very informative (assuming you actually include links). You don't have to follow this format, but it can give you an idea of what we want to see - Short description of highlights, and links to isses/commits/pull-requests that allow us to get more details.

 * I found several minor bugs (_links to issues_), and managed to fix a few of them (_links to commits or pull-requests_).
 * I suggested an improvement to the design of _component X_ (for more details, _link to issue_), as well as some additional useful features (_links to issues_).
 * I thought that the implementation of _component Y_ was very elegant - 
The use of _interface Z_ (_link to source file_) made it really easy to add _component Y_ to the rest of the system.

You can see all of my comments by searching for issues with the label _code-review-MyGitHubUsername_ (_link to search results_).
